            Staying hydrated is one of the simplest yet most powerful habits for maintaining good health. This page allows you to record your daily water intake, helping you build consistency and awareness around your hydration goals. By logging your water consumption each day, you create a personal history that reflects your commitment to wellness. Whether you're an athlete, a student, or someone simply trying to feel better, tracking your intake can reveal patterns and encourage better habits. Once you've added your intake for today, the system will prevent duplicate entries to ensure accuracy. If you're logged in, your data is securely stored and only visible to you. If you're not logged in, you can explore the site and learn more—but to begin tracking, you'll need to create an account or sign in. This feature is part of a broader effort to help you take control of your health, one glass at a time. So take a moment, reflect on your day, and record your progress. Every drop counts.
